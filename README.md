# TCN_Project_SAC_direction_selectivity
Understanding direction selectivity in  Starburst Amacrine cells using an integrated computational model- Degenerate mechanisms??
Here, we implement the known mechanisms of direction selectivity in SACs predicted from experiments. 
3D Morphology file (Taken from the neuromorpho database)-
SAC_model_varicos.hoc (with Varicosity)
SAC_model.hoc (without Varicosity- Uniform diameter)
Simulations file- (Different known mechanisms added- Single cell model)
SAC_varicos_simulator.hoc
SAC_Kv3_simulator.hoc
SAC_excite_simulator.hoc
SAC_inhibit_simulator.hoc
SAC_inhibit_simulator_2.hoc
Analysis files (Python)- Could be used to run the simulations (both directions), plot the voltage traces, and quantify direction selectivity (Mutual information, Direction selectivity index)
